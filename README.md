# Interactive Developer Roadmap Planner Demo

## Description

This project is a simple demonstration website designed as an interactive **Developer Roadmap Planner**. Its primary goal is to illustrate fundamental JavaScript concepts for manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) within a practical, thematic context. It showcases:

* Basic JavaScript function writing and event handling.
* Dynamically changing text content based on user interaction (e.g., revealing tips).
* Modifying element CSS styles using JavaScript (e.g., marking a topic as 'In Progress').
* Adding and removing HTML elements dynamically (e.g., adding/removing learning modules to a plan).
* Responding to user interactions via button clicks.

This project uses only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without external libraries or frameworks, focusing on core web technologies.

## Features

* **Roadmap-Themed Content:** All interactive elements relate to planning a developer learning path.
* **Dynamic Starting Tip:** Click a button to toggle between an introductory question about choosing a path and a helpful starting tip.
* **Mark Fundamentals 'In Progress':** Click a button to visually highlight the 'JavaScript Fundamentals' topic using CSS, simulating marking it as a current focus area. The button text also updates.
* **Add Learning Modules:** Dynamically add suggested learning modules (like Git, Frameworks, Databases) to a personalized roadmap list with a button click.
* **Remove Learning Modules:** Remove the most recently added learning module from the list with a button click.
* **Basic Semantic HTML5 Structure:** Utilizes elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.
* **Simple Responsive Styling:** Basic CSS provides layout and appearance.
* **Dynamic Copyright Year:** The year in the footer updates automatically using JavaScript.
